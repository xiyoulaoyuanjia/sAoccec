<p><strong>Organization of the Book</strong></p>
<p><strong>Solutions In This Chapter</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of each chapter a bulleted list of the major topics is provided. This provides
a high-level overview of the areas covered within the chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This section summarizes the most important Solutions covered in the chapter. A brief recap
of the information covered within the chapter is provided to give you a chance to go back
and review any topic that you may not have found clear the first time around.</p>
<p><strong>Solutions Fast Track</strong></p>
<p>The Solutions Fast Track provides an outline of each topic covered within the chapter. You
can use this section as a quick reference guide to quickly check which important facts are
covered in each chapter.</p>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p>At the end of each chapter a Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQ, section lists the most
common questions associated with the concepts covered in the chapter. These questions
were derived from questions posed to the OSSEC mailing list, asked at conferences, or
questions the authors felt might be asked in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter Descriptions</strong></p>
<p>Here is a brief overview of the information covered in each chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 1: Getting Started With OSSEC</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This chapter provides an overview of the features of OSSEC including commonly used
terminology, pre-install preparation, and deployment considerations.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 2: Installation</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This chapter walks through the installation process for the “local”, “agent”, and “server”
install types on some of the most popular operating systems available. Techniques to auto-
mate multiple agent installations are also covered in depth to ensure a smooth deployment
across multiple systems in a large environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 3: Configuration</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This chapter discusses the post-install configuration of OSSEC. Within this chapter you will
learn the basic configuration options for your install type and learn how to monitor log files,
receive remote messages, configure email notification, and configure alert levels.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 4: Working With Rules</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This chapter shows you how to extract key information from logs using decoders and how
you can leverage rules to alert you of strange occurrences on your network. It includes
examples on how to parse atomic and composite rules, how to keep state between messages,
how to remove false positives, and how to tune OSSEC appropriately for your network.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 5: System Integrity</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p><strong>Check and Rootkit Detection</strong></p>
<p>This chapter explains the system integrity check features of OSSEC, including monitoring
binary executable files, system configuration files, and the Microsoft Windows registry.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 6: Active Response Configuration</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Active response allows you to automatically execute “commands” or responses when a specific
event, or a set of events, occur. On the OSSEC HIDS, active response is very scalable, allowing
you to execute commands on the agent or on the server side. This chapter explains how to
configure the active response actions you want and how to bind the actions to specific rules
and sequence of events.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li>Chapter 7: Using the OSSEC Web User Interface</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>This chapter explains how to install, configure, and use the community-developed, open
source web interface available for OSSEC.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p>This chapter concludes the story carried throughout the book and provides some final
thoughts from the authors.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix A: Log Data Mining</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Anton Chuvakin, Chief Log Evangalist, LogLogic Inc.
This chapter is devoted to log mining or log knowledge discovery - a different type of
log analysis, which does not rely on knowing what to look for. This takes the “high art” of log
analysis to the next level by breaking the dependence on the lists of strings or patterns to
look for in the logs.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix B:</strong></p>
<p>Implementing a Successful OSSEC Policy</p>
<p>Michael J. Santarcangelo, II, Founder and Chief Security Catalyst, The Michaelangelo Group.
To be successful in implementing OSSEC in your organization, you need to have an
effective policy to guide and support your actions. This appendix will explain the steps you
need to take in order to quickly and successfully develop and implement your policy.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix C: Rootkit Detection Using Host-Based IDS</strong></p>
<p>By Peter Giannoulis and Adam Winnington, Information Security Consultants, Access 2 Networks
This appendix chapter provides a brief history of rootkits and how host-based IDS solutions
can assist in their prevention and detection. The positives and negatives of HIDS technologies
are also discussed.</p>
<p><strong>Appendix D: Using the OSSEC VMware Environment</strong></p>
<p>Included with the book is a DVD that contains a pre-configured Ubuntu 7.10 server running
the OSSEC HIDS. The OSSEC HIDS VMware Guest image allows you to implement what
you have learned in a sandbox-style environment. This appendix explains how the OSSEC
HIDS VMware Guest image was create and explains how you can create a OSSEC HIDS
VMware Guest image of your own.</p></div>
